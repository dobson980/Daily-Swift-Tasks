# Daily Swift Tasks

## Overview
**Daily Swift Tasks** is a personal Swift learning journey focused on improving Swift and SwiftUI skills through hands-on projects. This repository contains a collection of small, focused projects, each demonstrating a specific Swift or SwiftUI concept.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to build a deeper understanding of Swift and SwiftUI by implementing various concepts in self-contained projects. Each project is designed as a lesson, allowing for hands-on practice and reinforcing key development skills.

## Structure
Each folder in this repository contains a standalone Swift project, complete with its own README file explaining the concept covered, the implementation details, and instructions for running the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository using:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-swift-tasks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific project directory to view its README and implementation.
3. Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
4. Run the project on a simulator or device using `Cmd + R`.

## Learning Approach
- Each project focuses on a specific SwiftUI or Swift feature, keeping lessons manageable.
- Concepts are reinforced through hands-on coding rather than passive learning.
- README files provide structured explanations, making it easy to revisit and review past lessons.
- The repository will continue to grow with more projects over time.

## Future Improvements
As my Swift knowledge expands, future projects may include more advanced topics such as:
- Combine for reactive programming
- Swift Concurrency (async/await, tasks, and actors)
- Advanced SwiftData usage
- Custom animations and transitions
- UIKit interoperability

## Contributions
This is a personal learning project, but if you'd like to provide feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
